### [LOW PRIORITY] Centralized Supabase Client Instantiation
- **Status**: Backlog
- **Priority**: Low
- **Description**: Create a shared utility for centralized Supabase client instantiation to reduce code duplication and improve maintainability
- **Current State**: Supabase clients are instantiated in multiple places:
  - `src/lib/supabase.ts` (server-side)
  - `src/lib/supabase-client.ts` (client-side)
  - Direct instantiation in components using `createBrowserClient`
- **Proposed Solution**: 
  - Create `src/lib/supabase-utils.ts` with unified client creation
  - Implement environment-aware client selection
  - Add proper error handling and logging
  - Update all components to use centralized utility
- **Benefits**:
  - Reduced code duplication
  - Consistent error handling
  - Easier configuration management
  - Better testing capabilities
- **Estimated Effort**: 2-3 hours
- **Dependencies**: None
