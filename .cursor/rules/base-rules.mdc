### ðŸ›  Cursor Base Instructions

**App Summary:**
You are working on **StartIn** â€” a private, multi-tenant web app that lets users evaluate and engage with early-stage startups. It includes startup listings, structured ratings, interest signals, and public comment threads. Auth is via Supabase; UI is built with Next.js, Tailwind, and shadcn/ui components.

**Agent & File Management:**

* **Agent mode is enabled.**
* **Do not change file structure or create new folders** unless explicitly confirmed.
* **Keep all components and utilities in their existing locations.**

**Database Workflow:**

* **Supabase GUI is used** for schema changes and migrations.
* **Do not generate SQL migration files or modify `schema.sql`.**
* Assume RLS is enforced and the schema is already deployed.

**General Conventions:**

* Use TypeScript and follow current component structure and styles.
* Use `createClient` or `createBrowserClient` from `@/lib/supabase`.
* Assume multi-tenant structure â€” all rows tied to `user_id`.
